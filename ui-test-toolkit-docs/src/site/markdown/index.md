# What is UI Test Toolkit?

UI Test Toolkit is a software development kit for creating tests for UI elements (primarily Web pages). 
It abstracts the details of underlying implementation and provides a unified interface to work with UI that has API access
([Web](01_web.html), [SWT](05_swt.html)).

It also provides an image recognition tool [DesktopNavigator](07_desktop.html) that allows to work
with abstract UI applications, and is suitable for testing desktop applications which do not provide an API access.
