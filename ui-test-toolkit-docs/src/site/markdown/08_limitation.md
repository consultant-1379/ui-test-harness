During the execution of Element Manager suite on RadioNodes/RadioNodes NR, Firefox browser will be launched inside 3PP Cendio Thinlinc Remote Desktop. In rare scenario Firefox browser isn't load as per its default resolution resulting in the failure of EM suite in RNL. It cannot be addressed as this Firefox browser is inside 3PP Cendio Thinlinc Remote Desktop and it is not under the control of ENM GUI.
